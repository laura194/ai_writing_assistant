/* STYLES FOR THE APP COMPONENT 
 *
 * This file contains styles that are specific to the App component.
 * These styles will be applied to the App component and its children.

 * Here you define styles for Routing and Layout such as header, footer, and main content.
 * You can also define styles for specific components that are used in the App component.
 *
 * But like the global styles inside the index.css, be careful with the selectors you use.
