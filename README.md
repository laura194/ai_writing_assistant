## 🌟 Introduction

Members: Laura, Lisa, Gero, and Aylin

This repository contains a student project created for the ongoing course
on Study Project I & II at HWR Berlin, spanning the summmer term 2025 through 
the winter term 2026.

## 📖 Abstract

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application that supports users in the structured writing of academic texts. The application allows users to create, customize, and save chapter structures and provides AI-powered assistance during the writing process. All interactions with the AI are automatically documented to ensure transparency and traceability. The application combines modern web technologies with a user-friendly interface to enable efficient, structured, and methodologically sound work.

## 📱 Features Overview

- **Chapter Structure:** Create, customize, and save chapters and sections,
- **AI Assistance:** AI-powered suggestions and help during writing,
- **Protocol with filter:** Automatic documentation of all AI interactions for transparency,
- **Word Export:** Export the entire document as a Word file,
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive operation and modern design.
